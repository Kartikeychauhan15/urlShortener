So well after starting after so much long time now
 I will optimize more of my project. First I will see what my project 
 is looking exactly then i willl add atleast 5-7 features in it. 


----FEATURE DONE - CLICK ANALYTICS FEATURES IS ALREADY I HAVE DONE FROM THE VIDEO-----



-----------------Features will take suggestions from chatGPT-----------

FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS FOR URL SHORTENER PROJECT

1. QR Code Generation
This feature automatically generates a QR code for each shortened URL. 
A QR code can be scanned using any mobile device to open the link instantly. 
It makes the URL more convenient to share, especially for printed materials, 
documents, posters, and business cards. It adds a modern and practical layer to your 
URL shortener application.

So working process is down riht there ====>>

2. Link Expiration and Click Limit
This feature allows users to set an expiration time or a maximum number of allowed
 clicks for a link. Once the expiration date is reached or the click limit is exceeded,
  the link becomes inactive automatically. This is very useful for temporary or 
  time-limited sharing and adds more control and security to the user experience.

3. Device and Browser Tracking
This feature collects basic information about users when they click a shortened URL.
 It identifies:
- Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Operating system (Android, Windows, iOS, etc.)
This provides helpful analytics for understanding where users are coming from and how the link is being accessed.

4. Rate Limiting (Security Protection)
Rate limiting restricts how many requests a user can make in a specific time period.
 For example, one user can create only 10 short URLs per minute. This prevents spam,
  abuse, and server overload. It also protects the backend from DDoS attacks or malicious 
  use, enhancing the app's overall security.

5. Password-Protected Links
This feature allows users to set a password on a shortened URL. When someone tries 
to access the link, they must enter the correct password first. It adds privacy and 
security, especially for sensitive or private content. It also demonstrates encryption
 and secure access management within your backend.

6. Bulk URL Shortening
This feature allows users to upload a file (such as a CSV or JSON) containing 
multiple long URLs. The system processes the file and generates shortened URLs for 
all entries at once. This is useful for companies or individuals who need to generate
 many links quickly. It showcases advanced backend logic, file handling, and batch 
 processing capabilities.
